2021-12-15 12:18:37.729 +02:00 [WRN] Server msi:14260:db9b02ab was considered dead by other servers, restarting...
2021-12-15 12:18:38.355 +02:00 [WRN] Server msi:14260:db9b02ab stopped non-gracefully due to ServerWatchdog, ServerJobCancellationWatcher, ExpirationManager, CountersAggregator, Worker, DelayedJobScheduler, RecurringJobScheduler. Outstanding work on those dispatchers could be aborted, and there can be delays in background processing. This server instance will be incorrectly shown as active for a while. To avoid non-graceful shutdowns, investigate what prevents from stopping gracefully and add CancellationToken support for those methods.

2021-12-15 18:01:35.695 +02:00 [ERR] Server msi:14260:eacbeb92 will be restarted due to server time out
2021-12-15 18:01:35.709 +02:00 [WRN] Server msi:14260:eacbeb92 stopped non-gracefully due to ServerWatchdog, ServerJobCancellationWatcher, ExpirationManager, CountersAggregator, Worker, DelayedJobScheduler, RecurringJobScheduler. Outstanding work on those dispatchers could be aborted, and there can be delays in background processing. This server instance will be incorrectly shown as active for a while. To avoid non-graceful shutdowns, investigate what prevents from stopping gracefully and add CancellationToken support for those methods.
2021-12-15 18:01:36.839 +02:00 [WRN] Server msi:14260:eacbeb92 there was an exception, server may not be removed
